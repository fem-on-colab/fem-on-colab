This installation is offered by FEM on Colab, an open-source project
developed and maintained at Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore
by Dr. Francesco Ballarin. Please see https://fem-on-colab.github.io/
for more details, including a list of further available packages
and how to contribute to the project.

We are conducting an informal survey on FEM on Colab usage by our users.
The survey is anonymous, and its compilation will typically only require
a couple of minutes of your time. If you wish, give us your feedback at
