Due to a recent Google Colab breaking change, FEM on Colab now
requires a kernel restart for all of its packages to work properly.
The kernel will be now killed on your behalf, but you will have to
restart it manually. If this breaking change is affecting your work
please report so in the following issue in the Google Colab repository
https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/issues/3397
